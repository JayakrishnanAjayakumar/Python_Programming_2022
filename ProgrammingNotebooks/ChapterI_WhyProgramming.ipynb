    "**Reinventing the wheel** was a common thing during early days of programming as best practices such as **code sharing** was **virtually non-existent or very in-efficent** due to lack of web-technologies. \n",
    "Imagine you have written a fancy algorithm for sorting a large set of numbers in a small amount of time. Without code sharing, other researchers have to write their own sorting algorithm which might not be efficient as yours. So rather than working on the real scientific problem they might be working on solving un-important problems (of course if you are not a computer scientist) such as sorting. \n",
    "But now we have code sharing platforms such as GitHub and Bitbucket. If you have code that you want to share or want to use, you can always depend on such platforms. \n",

    "Languages such as **Python** are specifically designed for **expressing your research problem** rather than learning a bunch of programming constructs.  \n",

    "We are now in a **world of abstractions** (functional abstraction). With few lines of code we can develop a nueral network model as shown below, without getting into the nitty gritty details of calculus and other mathematical concepts. \n",
