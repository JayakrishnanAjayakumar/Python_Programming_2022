    "Because writing a program requires us to translate our ideas into a concise form that a computer can “understand,” it also necessarily improves our understanding of the problem itself. (Donald Knuth)\n",
    "....Thinking about how to solve a problem using a computer will help you to think more about the problem itself from various perspectives.....especially you will start thinking about things like how to do something efficiently and quickly.......So teaches you to think and teaches you to think deeply about a problem.......\n",

    "The ability to not only think and imagine, but also implement the idea you have thought about....that's the real power of programming.....and yeah we do have stalwarts around us.........\n",

Healthcare IT has already seen examples of tech companies recruiting physicians and surgeons across specialties. These doctors are taught basic coding skills and paired with a corps of formally trained software engineers and product teams to create specialty-specific solutions across medicine. This approach helps to ensure that the design of the software actually saves time and eases the burden of unnecessary documentation for the practicing clinician. It also allows physicians to continually improve upon the platform by using it in our own offices, providing real-time feedback on what we executed well, and identifying product needs.\n",
